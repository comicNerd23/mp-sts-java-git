//For classes, we can use only public, abstract, final not private, protected
//For classes without any access specifier, default access is given by JVM.
//A class inside a package has to be public for it to be accessed from outside

// Variables can have 4 access levels
//1. private: accessible only from the same class
//2. default: accessible from the same package
//3. protected: accessible from the same package, subclass in other packages
//4. public: accessible from anywhere
