/**
 * 	SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.
 * 	These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these
 *  practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development. 
 *  
 *  S - Single Responsibility Principle.
 * 	O - Open Closed Principle
 * 	L - Liskov's Substitution Principle
 * 	I - Interface Segregation Principle
 * 	D - Dependency Inversion Principle
 * 
 * 	In this article, you were presented with the five principles of SOLID Code. Projects that adhere to SOLID principles can be shared with collaborators, 
 * 	extended, modified, tested, and refactored with fewer complications.
