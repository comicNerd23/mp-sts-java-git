		//A .java file is first converted to a byte code (.class file) using a Java compiler.
		//The JVM is used to execute the java byte code in any environment (MAC, Windows, Linux).
		//That is why JVM is first required to run on your OS.
		//JVM comes packaged with JRE.
		//Check this article: https://dzone.com/articles/jvm-architecture-explained
		//JRE is part of JDK. It is a freely available software distribution which has Java Class Library,
		//specific tools, and a stand-alone JVM.
		//JDK is a wrapper around the JRE and additionally contains the compiler, interpreter,
		//debugger and other tools. It provides users with features to run as well as develop Java programs.
