/**
 * Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of 
 * the code they annotate.
 * Annotations in Java are used to provide additional information, so it is an alternative option for XML and Java marker interfaces.
 * 
 * Annotations have a number of uses, among them:
 * 1. Information for the compiler — Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings.
 * 2. Compile-time and deployment-time processing — Software tools can process annotation information to generate code, XML files, and so forth.
 * 3. Runtime processing — Some annotations are available to be examined at runtime.
 * 
 * Built-In Java Annotations used in Java code: @Override @SuppressWarnings @Deprecated
 * Built-In Java Annotations used in other annotations: @Target @Inherited @Retention @Documented
