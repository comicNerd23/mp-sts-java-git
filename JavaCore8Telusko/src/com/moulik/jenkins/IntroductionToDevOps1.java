/**
 * DevOps is the culmination of Dev (Development) and Ops (Operations) phase of building a product (software app). 
 * Dev goes through the plan(Modules and algorithms), code (Git), build(Maven, Gradle), test(Selenium) phases before 
 * readying the product for the Ops.
 * Ops goes through the deploy, operate (Ansible, Puppet, Docker) and monitor (Nagios) phases, and any feedback for the
 * application is given back to Dev. This integration of the two phases is called DevOps and one of the most popular 
 * tools for it is Jenkins. Other tools are Bamboo
 * 
 * Benefits: Sooner, Less Iterations, No Manual Work
