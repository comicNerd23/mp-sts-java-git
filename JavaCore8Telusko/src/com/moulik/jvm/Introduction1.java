 * A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs 
 * written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. (Scala, Groovy, Closure)
 * JVM helps Java achieve some of its goals like platform independence, security, very fast execution.
 * Just as for a CPU, machine code serves as an instruction set Similarly for JVM, Java bytecode serves as instruction set.
 * Like a real computing machine, JVM also manipulates memory at run-time. 
 * 
 * Core responsibilities:
 * 		Loading and interpreting bytecode
 * 		Security
 * 		Automatic Memory Management
